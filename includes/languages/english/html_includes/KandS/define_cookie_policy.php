<p>
	You have different options to manage the cookies on your computer or device. You can change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted, or, depending on which browser you are using, you might be able to <strong>receive an alert</strong> when a website is trying to place one on your browser. With most browsers you can allow first party cookies to be set but refuse third party cookies.</p>
<p>
	If you change your cookie preferences, you will still be able to browse around the site but certain functions will not be available, for example you will not be shop online, set up a new account or access an existing account. Also, by not allowing cookies, some of our standard functionality will not work, for example deleting certain cookies will sign you out of your EliteLightingNI.com account.</p>
<p>
	Your browsers &#39;help&#39; menu should tell you how to block cookies or change your cookie settings. How you adjust your browser will depend on the browser you are using.</p>
<p>
	You can <strong>delete cookies</strong> stored in your browser by using a function in your browser. Whilst this does not mean you won&#39;t collect cookies in the future, it gives you freedom to delete your cookies after you have been online. This function is often known as &#39;clearing cookies&#39;.</p>
<p>
	Clearing your cookies on one browser of one device does not automatically clear them on another. You need to clear all browsers on all channels independently.</p>
